# Data Science in Python from Scratch

# Style of notebooks
I write the notebooks to contain:

1) Intuition

2) Mathematics and Statistics behind the tool/algorithm

3) Code implementation from scratch (using numpy)

4) Application to real (publicly available) data

If you spot any mistakes in the code or the theory, feel free to raise an issue.
